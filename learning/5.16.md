# 5/16 progress:

Worked on backend development of translation functionality of Python application

Firstly, I learned how to set up the development environment, installing necessary Python packages 
such as `speech_recognition`, `requests`, and `azure-cognitiveservices-speech`, and configured the 
environment to include these libraries. 

**Current library functions:**




Secondly, I implemented the speech recognition functionality by utilizing the `speech_recognition` 
library to capture audio from the microphone, adjusting for ambient noise to improve recognition accuracy. 
I then used Google's speech recognition service to convert spoken Chinese (Mandarin) into text. 

Through this process, I learned how to capture and process audio input in Python and use external APIs for 
speech recognition. Additionally, I integrated the Microsoft Translator API to handle text translation from 
Mandarin to Cantonese, which involved understanding API request structures and handling JSON responses. 

I also explored Azure Cognitive Services' Speech SDK for converting the translated text into speech, learning how to
synthesize audio output and handle exceptions. Furthermore, I gained some insight into incorporating Large 
Language Models (LLMs) into projects, which enhanced my understanding of using advanced AI capabilities for
language processing tasks. 

This experience has significantly broadened my skills in working with APIs, managing 
audio input and output, and integrating complex AI models into applications.
